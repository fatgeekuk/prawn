= Hacking on Prawn

A stub file that'll eventually get bigger

== NOTES 

Install test-spec, pdf-reader, and mocha from RubyGems

Be sure to load in the necessary git submodules as well:

  git submodule init
  git submodule update

If you are running on Ruby 1.9.1, you will need Test::Unit 1.2.3

  gem install test-unit -v 1.2.3
  
== Patch process 

  1. File a ticket in Lighthouse describing your feature with 'request'
  2. Fork Prawn on Github, make your changes
  3. Submit pull request so Gregory is notified
  4. Link your commits on Lighthouse
  
  If you are working on a ticket that has already been created, skip step 1.
  
  All feature enhancements should come with an example in the examples/ dir,
  and preferably, some specs.
  
  All bug reports should have a reproducible example in bugs/ and preferably,
  some specs.
